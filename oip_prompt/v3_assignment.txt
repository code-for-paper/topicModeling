You will receive a document and a list of generalized topics (merged from many fine-grained topics). Your task is to:
1. Assign the document to the most relevant topics from the provided list
Note: Each topic is broad and may include several sub-topics or themes. Choose any topic that best represents the main content of the document.
2. For each assigned topic, extract keyword stems (common prefixes) that appear in the document and are relevant to that topic

[Topics]
{topics}

[CRITICAL Requirements for Keywords]
- Extract the STEM (common prefix) of words that appear in the document
- PRIORITIZE single word stems over multi-word phrases
- AVOID technical/academic terms and jargon (e.g., mRNA, RNA, siRNA, CRISPR, etc.)
- Focus on general business and operational terms
- Find the common prefix that covers different forms of the same word
- Each keyword stem must be derived from words that actually appear in the document
- Prefer common word stems that describe business activities, relationships, and processes

[Stem Extraction Rules]
1. For verbs: Find the common prefix across different tenses
   - engage, engaging, engages, engaged → "engag"
   - develop, developing, develops, developed → "develop"
   - collaborate, collaborating, collaborates, collaborated → "collaborat"

2. For nouns: Find the common prefix across singular/plural forms
   - partner, partners → "partner"
   - agreement, agreements → "agreement"
   - technology, technologies → "technolog"

3. For adjectives: Find the base form or common prefix
   - exclusive, exclusively → "exclusiv"
   - innovative, innovation → "innovat"

4. Keep simple words as-is if they don't have common variations
   - "research" → "research"
   - "patent" → "patent"

[Keyword Selection Priority]
1. Single word stems from common business terms
2. Stems that represent business activities, relationships, and processes
3. Avoid technical abbreviations and scientific terminology stems
4. Avoid proper nouns unless they represent a category

[Output Format]
[1] <TopicName>
    [2] <word_stem_from_document>
    [2] <another_word_stem>
    ...

[Examples]
Example 1: Stem extraction
Document:
"Our customers provide feedback through an online innovation portal, which we use to co-develop future features through collaborative workshops."
Your response:
[1] Customer Engagement
    [2] customer
    [2] feedback
    [2] innovat
    [2] develop
    [2] collaborat
    [2] workshop

Example 2: Business terms with stems
Document:
"We license our technology patents to external partners through exclusive agreements and collaborate with universities on research projects."
Your response:
[1] IP Licensing
    [2] licens
    [2] technolog
    [2] patent
    [2] external
    [2] partner
    [2] exclusiv
    [2] agreement
[1] University Collaboration
    [2] collaborat
    [2] universit
    [2] research
    [2] project

Example 3: What to extract vs avoid
Document: "The company develops siRNA therapeutics using advanced delivery platforms and manufacturing processes."
EXTRACT: [2] develop, [2] deliver, [2] platform, [2] manufactur, [2] process
AVOID: [2] siRNA, [2] therapeutics (too technical)

Example 4: Handling different word forms
Document: "We are developing partnerships with partners who partner with us in collaborative developments."
Your response:
[1] External Partnerships
    [2] develop (covers developing, developments)
    [2] partner (covers partnerships, partners, partner)
    [2] collaborat (covers collaborative)

[Instructions]
1. Read the document carefully and identify relevant topics
2. For each topic, scan the document for words that:
   - Are semantically related to the topic
   - Can be reduced to meaningful stems
   - Are general business/operational terms rather than technical jargon
   - Actually appear in some form in the document
3. Extract the common stem/prefix that covers different forms of the word
4. If a word doesn't have variations, use the base form
5. If no topics are relevant, return "None"
6. Prioritize extracting 3-8 word stems per topic
